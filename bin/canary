# Usage: canary COMMAND [ARGUMENTS...]
#
# Silences (both stdout and stderr) the given command only if it succeeds
# (exits with status 0) and then propagates its exit status to the caller.
#
# Like a canary in a coal mine, this program exists to vocalize failures.
# It also prints the given command and its failing exit status to stderr.
