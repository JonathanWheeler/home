# Wraps pigeon(1) so that it isn't confused by admit1(1) inside the COMMAND,
# since admit1(1) terminates with a zero exit status in two different cases:
#
#   1. Another instance of admit1(1) is already running COMMAND.
#   2. COMMAND completed and terminated with a zero exit status.
#
# In the first case, this program will terminate with an exit status of 143.
# Otherwise, this program will relay the underlying pigeon(1)'s exit status.
