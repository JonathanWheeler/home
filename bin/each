# NAME
#       each - loop over file paths
#
# SYNOPSIS
#       each [-n] <SCRIPT> <FILE_PATH>...
#       ls <FILE_PATH>... | each [-n] <SCRIPT>
#
# DESCRIPTION
#       Sets the following variables and evaluates the
#       given <SCRIPT> once for each given <FILE_PATH>.
#
#       $p = <FILE_PATH>
#       $f = <FILE_PATH> without directories (basename)
#       $n = <FILE_PATH> without directories and file extension
#       $d = <FILE_PATH> with only directories (dirname)
#       $x = <FILE_PATH> with only file extension
#       $X = <FILE_PATH> without file extension
#
#       These variable names come from Ruby's String#pathmap() method.
#
# OPTIONS
#       -n  Dry run.  Instead of evaluating the <SCRIPT>,
#           print what would happen if it were evaluated.
